Graph Coloring based Map Puzzle  
(Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Review 1)

## Project Overview
This project implements a **two-player map coloring game** based on the
**Graph Coloring problem**.

- Player 1: Human (plays using own logic)
- Player 2: Computer (uses Greedy Algorithm)
- Both players color regions on a **single shared grid**
- Constraint: No two adjacent regions can have the same color

## Algorithm Used
- Greedy Algorithm (CPU player)
- Graph represented using adjacency list

## Features
- GUI-based game using Python Tkinter
- Human vs Computer gameplay
- Penalty for invalid human moves
- Restart game functionality
- Clear end condition with winner declaration

## Technology Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)

## How to See Video
```bash
